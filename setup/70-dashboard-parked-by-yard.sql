-- Parking Ops — database part 70: the dashboard's Parked now, by yard.
--
-- owner_dashboard() as part 66, plus parked.yards: the cars in the car park
-- right now counted by yard (NB, S, CP… and '' for no yard yet), each split by
-- return day (day null = past its return). The app shows "Parked now, by yard".
-- Reads only; nothing changes. Safe to run twice. Needs part 66.
